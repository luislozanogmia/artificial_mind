# Artificial Mind ‚Äî Open Source Layers

A modular agentic AI framework for building reflection-first, validation-driven systems.

**Open-source implementation of all six modular layers of the Artificial Mind:**  
Perception ‚Ä¢ Grounding ‚Ä¢ Validation ‚Ä¢ System Identity ‚Ä¢ Expression ‚Ä¢ Execution.

Each layer is a complete, working engine. For example The AX Executor handles the **how** (clicking, typing, launching apps with full validation). You handle the **what and when** (integrating it into your agent's decision-making pipeline, workflow orchestration, and state management).

## üß© Layer Overview

- **Perception:** Captures input from users and systems to sense and interpret context.  
- **Grounding:** Maintains real-time state and execution history for stability.  
- **Validation:** Filters and rejects invalid outputs before generation.  
- **System Identity:** Preserves consistent behavior across sessions and model swaps.  
- **Expression:** Translates validated intent into clear, structured language.  
- **Execution:** Delivers deterministic, reliable automation that acts safely on the world.

## üöÄ Purpose

This repository serves as the **open-source foundation** for developers building **agentic AI prototypes**.  
Each layer can be extended, replaced, or combined to form complete, reflection-first cognitive systems.
